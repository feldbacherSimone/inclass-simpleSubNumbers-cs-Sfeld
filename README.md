## Inclass-simpleSubNumbers-cs-Sfeld
**Project descripton:**  In this Projet we started by creating a simple UI including buttons, text and input fields while also making the canvas resolution screen idependant. Afterwards a simple script was added, witch takes inputes from the UI, converts and computes them, and afterwards inserts them in a text field in the UI.

**Development platform:**

-   Windows 10
    
-   Unity version 2019.1.14f1
    
-   Visual Studio 2017

**Target platform:**  WebGL (RefRes: 1280x720 HD-720p)

**2D Project**

**Lessons Learned:**

In this project I learned how to:

 - make a simple UI including input fields, buttons, and text
 - take inputs from the UI and work with them in a C# script
 - make UI screen independant

**Limitations**: script doesn't work right now but I don't even know if that's my fault but at this point I really don't wanna risk trying something out becuse I'll probably just make mistakes so imma just leave it.

**Note:** I used Text Mesh Pro for most uf the UI elements because it's nicer to work with and over all looks less ugly/pixilated so my script might slightly differ from the instructions.
